## Model definition:

### States  

|                         | $A$                   | $S$                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| TB-related symptoms     | No                    | Yes                 |
| Care-seeking intentions | No                    | Yes                 |
| TB-related mortality    | No                    | Yes                 |
| Sputum smear microscopy | Usually low precision | Positive / Negative |

- $A$: Asymptomatic TB
- $S$: Symptomatic TB, before case-detection


### Dynamics

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("diags/model1.jpg")
```

Subject to a **Steady-declining solution** where the annual decline rates: prevalence = incidence = notification = $\phi$


## Empirical model

### Prevalence

We related the prevalence, $Prev_A$ and $Prev_S$, to prevalence survey data with the $Binomial$ distribution, where

$$\begin{array}{rl}
Prev_A &= \frac{\gamma_S + \rho - \phi}{\gamma_S + \rho - \phi + \theta} \times Prev  \\
Prev_S &= \frac{\theta}{\gamma_S + \rho - \phi + \theta} \times Prev
\end{array}$$


- $Prev$: the prevalence of all active TB.


### Notification

We related the time-series of case notification rates, $CNR_{S, t}$, to case-notification and demographic data with the $Poisson$ distribution, where 

$$CNR_{S, t} = \rho Prev_S \times e^{-\phi (t - t0)}$$

- $t$: year
- $t0$:  the year with the prevalence survey


### Prior distribution


$$\begin{array}{rl}
\theta & \sim invGamma(1, 1)\\
\rho & \sim invGamma(1, 1)\\
\nu & \sim U(0.1, 0.3)\\
\phi & \sim U(-0.2, 0.2)\\
Prev & \sim U(0, 1)
\end{array}$$



The model fitting were implemented ``R``  with ``rstan``.

#### Notations


- $\theta$: Symptom onset rate                                
- $\rho$: Care-seeking rate

- $\nu$: Self-cure rate 
- $\mu$: Background death rate                        
- $\mu_{S}$: Untreated death rate of state $S$            

- $\phi$: Annual decline rate for incidence/prevalence/notification

- $\gamma_A = \nu + \mu$: Dropout rate of $A$ (self-cure + death)
- $\gamma_S = \nu + \mu + \mu_S$: Dropout rate of $S$ (self-cure + death)
